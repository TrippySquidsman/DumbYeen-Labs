## Step 1: Prepare Your Server

1. **Choose a server**: Use a dedicated VPS or physical machine.  
2. **Operating system**: Linux distributions like Ubuntu, Debian, or CentOS are commonly used.  
3. **Domain name**: Ensure you own a domain name (e.g., `yourdomain.com`) and have DNS control.  
4. **Update your server**:  
   ```bash
   apt update && apt upgrade -y

## Step 2: Set Up DNS Records

Configure DNS records for your domain:

- **A Record**: Points your domain to your server's IP address.
    - `mail.yourdomain.com` → `[Your Server IP]`
- **MX Record**: Directs emails to your mail server.
    - `yourdomain.com` → `mail.yourdomain.com` (Priority: 10)
- **PTR Record**: Set up reverse DNS with your hosting provider (PTR record should match `mail.yourdomain.com`).
- **SPF Record**: Helps prevent email spoofing.
    - `v=spf1 mx ~all`
- **DKIM Record**: For email authenticity.
- **DMARC Record**: To specify your domain’s email policy.
